					information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs.  For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you use the Services again, it will recognize you and

					Data.<br />‍<br />
					<strong>Cookies</strong> <br />Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information.  “<strong>Cookies</strong>” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you
					are viewing the website.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and
					interactive experience on our Services.    This type of information is collected to make the Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. <br />‍<br />

					receive reports based on these parties’ use of these tools on an individual or aggregate basis.  We use the information we get from Analytics Services only to improve our Services.  The information generated by the
					Cookies or other technologies about your use of our Services (the “<strong>Analytics Information</strong>”) is transmitted to the Analytics Services. The Analytics Services use Analytics Information to compile reports on
					user activity. The Analytics Services may also transfer information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process Analytics Information on their behalf. Each Analytics Services’
